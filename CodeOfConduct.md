# Community Code of Conduct

## Our Mission

Welcome to The VRse, a vibrant space for enthusiasts, developers, and gamers united by a common goal: to enjoy Star Citizen in Virtual Reality. While we eagerly await native VR support from Cloud Imperium Games, we're here to make the Star Citizen universe accessible and immersive through various VR patching tools and discussions.

## Core Values

### Respect and Kindness

- **Play Nice**: We encourage camaraderie, collaboration, and friendly banter. A little ribbing is part of the game, but it should always be in good spirits and never at someone's expense.
- **Inclusivity**: Our community thrives on diversity. Discrimination or harassment based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, or any other personal characteristic will not be tolerated.
- **Privacy**: Protect your personal information and respect others' privacy. Do not share personal information (PII) without consent, and avoid doxxing at all costs.

### Safety and Reporting

- **Stay Safe**: We encourage members to prioritize their safety and privacy. While we strive to maintain a secure environment, members are also responsible for their own digital footprint.
- **Speak Up**: If you encounter behavior that violates our code, please report it to the mods or admin team. We're committed to addressing issues fairly and promptly.

### Gaming Integrity

- **Fair Play**: While our tools bypass certain software limitations to enable VR, this is strictly for enhancing our gaming experience without gaining unfair advantages.
- **Legal Compliance**: Our activities aim to respect the creators' rights and the legal boundaries of software modification. We do not support piracy or illegal modding.

## Enforcement and Consequences

- **Moderation**: Our mod and admin teams are here to ensure the community remains a welcoming place for all. We reserve the right to mute, kick, or ban members as necessary.
- **Accountability**: Violations of our code will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering the context and impact of the behavior.
- **Feedback Loop**: Members who face disciplinary action will have the opportunity to discuss their behavior with the moderation team to understand the impact and how to move forward positively.

## Adaptation and Evolution

This Code of Conduct applies to all community interactions, including Discord discussions and any collaborative spaces related to our project. We commit to revising and updating our policies as our community grows and evolves, always with the aim of fostering a positive and inclusive environment for everyone involved in making Star Citizen playable in VR.
